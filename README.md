## 📖 Introduction 

### BANG is an all-in-one teaching workbench designed to empower language educators.

- **What does BANG stand for?**

  English: Building Adaptive Next-Generation Growth Platform.

  Chinese: The pronunciation echoes "帮" (Help) and "棒" (Excellence).

  This dual meaning symbolizes our core mission: to support ("帮") learners and teachers, helping them achieve excellent ("棒") outcomes through adaptive technology and data-driven insights.
